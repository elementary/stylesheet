# The Gtk+ Stylesheet for elementary OS

[![Bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/badge/tracker?tracker_id=45189256)](https://www.bountysource.com/trackers/45189256-elementary-stylesheet)

An original Gtk.CSS stylesheet designed specifically for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io) and its desktop environment: Pantheon.

This stylesheet is licensed openly under the terms of the [GNU General Public License](https://github.com/elementary/stylesheet/blob/master/COPYING). Redistributing, forking, remixing, etc. are encouraged!

If you feel the desire to compensate the designers who maintain this stylesheet for your usage, [please see this page](https://elementary.io/get-involved#funding) and thank you!

## Not a General Purpose Stylesheet

Special fixes for GNOME apps (Nautilus, GNOME Control Center, GNOME Shell, etc) or other desktop environments will not be implemented. The aim of style classes should be to be generic across applications. If an application needs a unique style,  it should be bundled with that application.
